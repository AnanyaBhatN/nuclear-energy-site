## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Break down nuclear energy concepts into simple, digestible sections
- Guide users linearly through learning (Basics → Mechanics → Benefits → Risks → Myths → Future → Resources)
- Demonstrate **UI/UX design thinking** through structure, navigation, and interaction design

## 🧠 Learning Flow

1. **Basics** – Atomic structure, fission vs fusion  
2. **Reactor Mechanics** – How nuclear reactors generate electricity  
3. **Benefits** – Clean energy, high efficiency, reliability  
4. **Risks & Safety** – Waste, accidents, and modern safety systems  
5. **Fact vs Fiction** – Debunking common nuclear myths  
6. **Future Tech** – SMRs and nuclear fusion  
7. **Resources** – Verified references for deeper learning  

Each section uses a consistent **“Continue” CTA** to reduce cognitive load and guide users forward.
